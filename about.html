            <h1>Hi, I'm Rob.</h1>
            <div id="article">
                <p>I currently work as a technology consulting analyst with <a href="https://www.accenture.com/ca-en" targer="blank">Accenture</a>.</p>  
                <p>I grew up in Toronto and graduated from the University of Toronto with a degree in civil engineering and a minor in busines.</p>

                <h2>Programming</h2>
                <p>I developed a passion for programming towards the end of my undergrad. Coming from a civil engineering background the opportunities to code were few and far between, however, after taking an online iOS dev course I was hooked.</p>
                <p>It wasn't until after I graduated and worked at <a href='https://www.facebook.com/hatchery123/videos/vb.100003548364529/765258230269115/?type=2' target='blank'>The Hatchery</a> that I realized my love for creating.</p>
                <p>I am a <a href='http://mentormee.info/' target='blank'>co founder</a>, an <a href='https://itunes.apple.com/ky/app/eddgi/id1061188451?mt=8' target='blank'>app creator</a> and a tech enthusiast.</p>

                <h2>Fitness</h2>
                <p>I try to lead a healthy lifestyle. I enjoy cooking, gyming and cycling. Last year I ran my first (and probably last) <a href='assets/Triathlon.JPG' target='blank'>triathlon</a>. I'm always open to new foods and workouts.</p>
                <p>Physical and mental health are very important to me.</p>
