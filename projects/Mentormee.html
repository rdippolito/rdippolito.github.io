                        <p>The mobile application was coded in Objective-C. User information was stored in a SQL server and a PHP web service was used to communicate between the server and the application.</p>
                        <p>Mentormee was created out of the University of Toronto's startup incubator <a href ='https://hatchery.engineering.utoronto.ca/team/mentormee/' target='blank'>The Hatchery</a>. Mentormee was a finalist and pitched to angels and VCs at demo day.</p>
                        <p>Mentormee is an ongoing project that strives to help students understand what they want to get out of their post secondary experience.
